# scib-test
The single cell integration tutorial based on https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01336-8.
It uses https://github.com/theislab/scib to perform integration by couple of methods and QC.
It uses scib wrappers for integrations that in turn uses default settings for integration methods that may be not perfect. It was done for demonstration only, please use methods itself in real life.
See scripts/make_env.txt for instructions for how to make environment.
